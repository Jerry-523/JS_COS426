## Getting Started
The JavaScript based image processing program has two modes: 
- (1) an interactive mode where you can enable/disable various filters, adjust parameters to these filters, and see the result right away; and
- (2) a batch mode where all the filters and parameters are fixed via the URL string. In general, you will find the interactive mode more useful for testing your programs during development, whereas you will find the batch mode more useful for generating output images while composing the writeups for your assignments.
